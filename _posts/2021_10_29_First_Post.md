### October 29th, 2021

This is the initial commit of my GH Page static site. 

My name is Joel, I'm a DevOps Engineer at Taos Mountain, an IBM company. Over the last two years I've been on assignment at Google working as an Apigee Support Engineer. Where I help support the [Apigee](https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/get-started/what-apigee-edge) that allows for the development and management of APIs. 

Before my current assignemt, I was a member of the Google Cloud Platform support team where I specialized with the Infrastructure based products (e.g. [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/), [Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), Stackdriver [Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring) / [Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging)). I grew to love the Infrastructure and maintenance side of Cloud services.
